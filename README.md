same as my other DLA thing but takes an image as an input and spits out an edited version. 

also added windows background changing support for a friend but it will probb get flagged as a trojan so good luck with that

# instructions
## (that i wrote a month ago)

this thing generates a random background based on a referance image, % of pixels to add and your colours of choice.

changing the size of the input image ("./dlaimgs/ref.png") changes how many pixels are simulated. increasing the size does increase the simulation time. you can make your own referance images if you want;
black isnt a wall and everything else is
